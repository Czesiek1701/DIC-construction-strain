trackPointsstrain.py   - main script for tracking points
myDIClibrary.py        - library for processing pictures
nodesStrain.py         - calculate and plot the strain from grid of points
mp4.py                 - script makes png frames from recorded by camera video
make_test_video.py     - script makes video and saves start and end positions of points fixed with blooms
blooms.py              - class for creating, moving and plotting random blooms

First set paths and start mp4.py to generate single frames. Next set paths and method parameters to run script trackPointsstrain.py which returns end positions of given points.
To validate program frames with blooms can be generated in make_test_video.py. Script returns also start and end positions of points for comparison with calculated results.S
